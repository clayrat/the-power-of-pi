== Data.Cryptol

[*Source*](src/Data/Cryptol.lidr)

Here we're modeling [*Cryptol*][Cryptol], a domain-specific language for
cryptographic protocols developed by [Galois, Inc][Galois].

> module Data.Cryptol

Since we'll need to operate on vectors, we import [`Data.Vect`], which provides
the `Vect` data type.

> import Data.Bit
> import Data.Vect

`Data.Vect` provides [`splitAt`][splitAt]:

```idris
splitAt : (n : Nat) -> (xs : Vect (n + m) a) -> (Vect n a, Vect m a)
```

... and [`partition`][partition]:

```idris
partition : (a -> Bool) -> Vect n a -> ((p ** Vect p a), (q ** Vect q a))
```

... but, not `split`, so we define it here.

> export
> split : (n : Nat) -> (m : Nat) -> Vect (m * n) a -> Vect m (Vect n a)
> split n  Z    [] = []
> split n (S k) xs = take n xs :: split n k (drop n xs)

[splitAt]: https://github.com/idris-lang/Idris-dev/blob/v0.12.2/libs/base/Data/Vect.idr#L446-L452
[partition]: https://github.com/idris-lang/Idris-dev/blob/v0.12.2/libs/base/Data/Vect.idr#L454-L461

The `TakeView` provides a way to pattern match on taking `m` elements from a
vector with `m + n` elements, leaving a vector with `n` elements remaining.

It's entirely similar to [`splitAt`][splitAt] and could probably be deprecated
in favor of it.

> public export
> data TakeView : (a : Type) -> (m, n : Nat) -> Vect (m + n) a -> Type where
>   Take : (xs : Vect m a) -> (ys : Vect n a) -> TakeView a m n (xs ++ ys)

The covering function `takeView` takes an `m` and a vector with `m + n` elements
and returns the appropriate `TakeView`, which can then be used for pattern
matching.

N.B. As of now, this definition is *not* recursive and thus not the most
efficient.
